# Code Dojo Tic-Tak-Toe :x: | :o: | :x:
After a late night session watching 1983 cult classic movie [War Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames), Lonny decided to create a tic-tac-toe game (naughts and crosses to you and me).

Having breezed through the UI, Lonny got stuck on the logic to decide if a player has won the game.

## Your mission... :alarm_clock:
Take over where Lonny has failed.  You will find acceptance criteria in `WinnerCheck.test.ts` and a method signature in `WinnerCheck.ts`.

You get extra kudos for going beyond a basic walker/simulation approach. Can you think of an efficient way to calculate a winner / tie for an n x n grid?

For even greater admiration, extend this project to allow a human to play the computer, or for proper old-school street cred, for the computer to play itself!
